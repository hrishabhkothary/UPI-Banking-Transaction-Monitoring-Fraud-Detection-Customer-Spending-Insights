# 📊 UPI & Banking Transaction Monitoring, Fraud Detection & Customer Spending Insights


## 🚀 Overview

This project is an **industrial-grade pipeline** for monitoring, analyzing, and detecting fraud in large-scale **electronic banking and UPI transactions**.  
It demonstrates **end-to-end data engineering**, **machine learning for anomaly detection**, and **customer spending insights** using **Python**, **MySQL**, and powerful open-source libraries.

## 📌 Objective:
-Ingest large volumes of UPI + general banking transactions.

-Store them in a relational database (MySQL) with a well-designed schema.

-Process and clean data with Python ETL pipelines.

-Detect anomalies/fraud using unsupervised learning.

-Provide behavior insights (average spends, top merchants, time-of-day heatmaps).

-Validate the entire pipeline with automated tests.

-Show scalable design — suitable for live transaction streams.


## 🎯 **Key Features**

- **Large-scale synthetic data generation:** Simulates 50,000 realistic UPI & banking transactions using `Faker` for user behavior, locations, amounts, devices, and VPA IDs.
- **ETL Pipeline:** Cleans raw transaction data, adds unique IDs, validates timestamps, and loads clean records into a structured **MySQL** database.
- **Anomaly/Fraud Detection:** Uses an **Isolation Forest** ML algorithm to detect unusual high-value transactions — helping financial institutions flag suspicious activity.
- **Customer Insights & Reporting:** Provides average spend analysis, top payees, and visual time-based spending trends.
- **Automated Testing:** Unit tests for data integrity, timestamp checks, and ML output sanity checks to ensure reliability.
- **Fully Modular:** Cleanly separated scripts for ETL, ML, and reporting, ready for production or integration with real-time systems.
